# Open Data Policies Decoded

## What is Open Data Policies Decoded?
[Open Data Policies Decoded](http://opendatapoliciesdecoded.sunlightfoundation.com/) is a free, open source, web-based application to provide better access to open data policies from various jurisdictions (starting with US cities) online. It's a project based on ("forked from") [The State Decoded](http://www.statedecoded.com/), but differs in that rather than making all the laws _within_ a jurisdiction more accessible, Open Data Policies Decoded provides this function for laws/policies related to open data _across_ various jurisdictions. By utilizing [State Decoded XML Documentation](http://docs.statedecoded.com/xml-format.html) to structure open data policy text, Open Data Policy Decoded makes the language of open data reform more searchable, interconnected, and [machine-readable](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#open-formats), adding an [API](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#public-apis), [bulk downloads](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/#bulk-data), and semantic analysis tools. 

By providing easier to read, more useful, and more _open_ open data policies our goal is to empower government officials and open government advocates alike to more easily mix and match the [best aspects](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/examples/) of various open data policies "re-forming" reforms and ultimately facilitating the spread of good policy ideas across jurisdictions in the true spirit of open source culture. 

## I'm a government official. How do I add my jurisdiction's open data policy?
